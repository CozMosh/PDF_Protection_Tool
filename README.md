# PDF_Protection Tool 

## üéØ Objective

The PDF Protection Tool is designed to add password protection to PDF files. This tool allows users to secure their PDF documents by encrypting them with a password. It uses the pikepdf library to open, encrypt, and save a PDF file with user-defined security settings. This tool is useful for ensuring the confidentiality and protection of sensitive documents by preventing unauthorized access.

### üß† Skills Learned

- Working with the pikepdf library for handling PDF files.
- Understanding PDF encryption mechanisms and how to apply them using Python
- Gaining experience in building command-line tools that accept user inputs.
- Handling errors and exceptions effectively in Python scripts.
-Basic usage of sys.argv for command-line arguments in Python.

### üõ† Tools Used

- **pikepdf**: A library for reading and writing PDF files in Python, with support for encryption.
- **sys.argv**: Used to pass command-line arguments to the script.
- Custom subdomain wordlist **(subdomains.txt)** for testing.
- Python's exception handling: To catch and report errors during file processing.

## üõ† Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

### **Step 1**: Import Necessary Libraries.
```python
import pikepdf
import sys
```

### **Step 2**:: Define the Function to Protect the PDF.
This function opens the input PDF, applies encryption using the provided password, and saves the output PDF with password protection.
```python
def protect_pdf(input_pdf, output_pdf, password):
    try:
        pdf = pikepdf.open(input_pdf)
        pdf.save(output_pdf, encryption=pikepdf.Encryption(owner=password, user=password, R=4))
        print(f"Password-protected PDF saved as {output_pdf}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### **Step 3**:: Define the Main Function to Parse Command-Line Arguments.
This function checks if the correct number of arguments are provided. It then calls the protect_pdf function with the input PDF, output PDF, and password.
```python
def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 4:
        print("Usage: python3 script.py <input_pdf> <output_pdf> <password>")
        sys.exit(1)

    input_pdf = sys.argv[1]
    output_pdf = sys.argv[2]
    password = sys.argv[3]

    protect_pdf(input_pdf, output_pdf, password)
```

### **Step 4**:: Run the Script.
If this script is executed directly (not imported as a module), the main() function will be called.
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## üõ† File Structure
```
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input.pdf            # Your source PDF file that you want to protect
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output.pdf           # The output PDF file with password protection
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pdf_protection.py    # The Python script that adds password protection to the PDF

```
